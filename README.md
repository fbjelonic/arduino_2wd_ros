# arduino_2wd_ros

This is a simple arduino sketch. You can use it to control your smart arduino 2wd car.\
If you want to directly use it with your arduino car, you need to set up the wiring following the guide on Page 14:\

Alternatively, you can wire it up yourself. Just make sure, to change the gpio pins in the sketch to the 
appropriate ones.
